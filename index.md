This lesson aims to teach responsible machine learning practices with a focus on fairness, explainability, and reproducibility.

:::::::::: prereq
- Participants should have experience using Python. 
- Participants should have a basic understanding of machine learning (e.g., familiar with the concepts like train/test split and cross-validation) and should have trained at least one model in the past.
- Participants should care about the interpretability, reproducibility, and/or fairness of the models they build.
- Participants should have domain knowledge of the field they work in and want to build models for.

## Setup Instructions

### Clone the git project

There are a number of files we need to conduct the workshop. By cloning the git repository, you will be able to have a copy of all of the necessary files and functions required to run through the exercises.

1. Click the link below to open the [Github](https://github.com/annapmeyer/fair-explainable-ml/tree/main) page.
2. Click the green "Code <>" button.
3. Click "Download as zip."
4. Unzip the directory to your desktop or working directory.

### Create a Hugging Face account and access Token
You will need a Hugging Face account for the workshop episode on model sharing. Hugging Face is a very popular machine learning (ML) platform and community that helps users build, deploy, share, and train machine learning models. 

To create an account on Hugging Face, visit: [https://huggingface.co/join](https://huggingface.co/join). Enter an email address and password, and follow the instructions provided via Hugging Face (you may need to verify your email address) to complete the process.


Once you have your account created, you'll need to generate an *access token* so that you can upload/share models to your Hugging Face account during the workshop. To generate a token, visit the [Access Tokens setting page](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) after logging in. Once there, click "New token" to generate an access token. We'll use this token later to log in to Hugging Face via Python.
