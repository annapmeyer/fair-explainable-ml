:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- What is distribution shift? How can we know if distribution shift has occured?
- What is a model card?
- How do I share a model so that others may use it?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Understand distribution shift and its implications.
- Apply model-sharing best practices through using model cards.
- Understand the technical and communication norms around sharing models.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Distribution shift is common. It can be caused by temporal shifts (i.e., using old training data) or by applying a model to new populations.
- Distribution shift can be addressed by TODO
- Model cards are the standard technique for communicating information about how machine learning systems were trained and how they should and should not be used.
- Models can be shared and reused by doing TODO
