:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- Why is model sharing important in the context of reproducibility and responsible use?
- What are the challenges, risks, and ethical considerations related to sharing models?
- How can model-sharing best practices be applied using tools like model cards and the Hugging Face platform?
- What is distribution shift and what are its implications in machine learning models?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Understand the importance of model sharing and best practices to ensure reproducibility and responsible use of models.
- Understand the challenges, risks, and ethical concerns associated with model sharing.
- Apply model-sharing best practices through using model cards and the Hugging Face platform.
- Understand distribution shift and its implications.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Model cards are the standard technique for communicating information about how machine learning systems were trained and how they should and should not be used.
- Models can be shared and reused via the Hugging Face platform.
- Distribution shift is common. It can be caused by temporal shifts (i.e., using old training data) or by applying a model to new populations.
- Distribution shift can be addressed by TODO
